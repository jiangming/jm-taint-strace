We extend TEMU, a whole-system dynamic binary
analysis platform, to perform taint analysis on linux system calls.
we intercept system calls in TEMUâ€™s
instrumentation to obtain real-time system call information
including the system call numbers, arguments, and returns.
We then label the return values and out-arguments of all
system calls as taint sources. Please see our paper:
